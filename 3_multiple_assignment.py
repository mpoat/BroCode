# multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code

# name = "Mike"
# age = 33
# attractive = True

name, age, attractive = "Mike", 21, True # This does the same as above just in one line of code

#print(name)
#print(age)
#print(attractive)

#Spongebob = 30
#Patrick = 30
#Sandy = 30
#Squidward = 30

Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30 # This is the same as the 4 lines above

print(Spongebob)
print(Patrick)
print(Sandy)
print(Squidward)
